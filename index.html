            <h1>This is Dashiell, My Cat</h1>
            <p>    I found a litter of kittens in 2010 and adopted two of them, a pair I named Clementine and Dashiell.  Clementine is everyone's cat; always open to affection, playing coy and getting any person around to pet her.  Dashiell, though, is my cat.  He's a good buddy. If he were human he would be that weird skinny guy who chain-smokes and has a knife collection.  He likes to stay out all night, take my chair whenever I get up, and eat the best bits of his sister's food.  He's a special cat to me.  He was sick back in 2013 and nearly died several times during that period.  He owes his life in no small part to the people at Animal Trustees of Austin.  Overall he is a very affectionate cat (to me) and he likes to sit in my underwear when I'm on the toilet for some reason beyond my understanding.</p>
